// A point in the x-y plane is represented by its x-coordinate and y-coordinate. Design a class,
// PointType in Java, that can store and process a point in the x-y plane. You should then
// perform operations on the point, such as showing the point, setting the coordinates of the
// point, printing the coordinates of the point, returning the x-coordinate, and returning the ycoordinate. Every circle has a centre and a radius. Given the radius, we can determine the
// circle’s area and circumference. Given the centre, we can determine its position in the x-y
// plane. The centre of a circle is a point in the x-y plane. Design a class, CircleType that can
// store the radius and centre of the circle. Because the center is a point in the x-y plane and
// you designed the class to capture the properties of a point from PointType class. You must
// derive the class CircleType from the class PointType. You should be able to perform the
// usual operations on a circle, such as setting the radius, printing the radius, calculating and
// printing the area and circumference, and carrying out the usual operations on the center
