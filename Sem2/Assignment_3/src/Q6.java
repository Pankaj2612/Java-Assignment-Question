// Write a simple main class in Java that contains an experiment that uses the generic Box<T>
// class to build boxes with different types and that verifies that this class works as advertised.
// Your experiment should include the following:
//  Create a boxed String object and two variables that refer to that box. Change the contents
// of one and determine the effect on the other.
//  Create a boxed Integer object and two variables that refer to that box. Change the
// contents of one and determine the effect on the other.
//  Create a boxed Object object and two variables that refer to that box. Determine what
// happens if you put a string in the box. Determine what happens if you put an integer in
// the box.
